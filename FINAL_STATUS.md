## 🎯 **How to Submit Your Application:**

### **Your Message:**

```
Hey there, hope you're doing well!

I built you a quick demo - check it out here:

🔗 Live Demo: https://creademo.vercel.app
📂 GitHub: https://github.com/Sepsepi/CREADEMO

Since I don't have CREA DDF API access yet, I created mock data with 28 realistic Ontario property listings to show how everything works. Backend is on Render, frontend on Vercel.

Features:
• Property search with filters (city, price, beds, baths, type)
• Detail pages with photo galleries
• Responsive design (try it on mobile!)
• Full API documentation
• Production-ready architecture

When we get real CREA credentials, swapping in the live data is just a 2-3 hour job - everything's structured for it.

Let me know if you're interested and we can chat about details and timeline!

Thanks,
Sepi
